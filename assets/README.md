Place your PALMARINA hero image in this folder as `palmarina-hero.jpg`.

- **Recommended**: a warm-toned, soft-focus landscape or coastal shot with subtle palm or foliage elements.
- **Ratio**: visually works best around 3:2 or 16:10; the layout will crop it responsively.

If this file is missing or the image fails to load, the page will gracefully fall back to a sand-toned gradient so the layout still feels intentional and complete.
